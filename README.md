# Minecraft-Infinite-Enchantments

This datapack is a silly idea inspired by PhoenixSC's (yt: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj4zC1Hfj-uc90FUXzRamNw) multishot datapack (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es_wsrkjOJg).
The principle is simple: you throw two of the same items on an anvil and voila, their enchantments are combined.

Enjoy ;)
